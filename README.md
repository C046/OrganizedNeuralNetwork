# OrganizedNeuralNetwork

Just a simple neural network that I am slowly but surely building.
Starting everything from scratch to get a full understanding of how a network
and input pipelines actually work while at the same time building ways to 
garner a database thats not exhaustive after 2-5 use cases. 
 
to use the network, or how to use it. For binary cross-entropy training/ loss calculation for breast cancer, see example in `NetworkUsage.py`

# Things I have to do
- Implement backwards propagation on the loss calculation.
- Test & evaluate.
